<details><summary>Why Qubex?</summary>

Because Web3 needs an infrastructure that anticipates the post-quantum era and eliminates value capture by MEV. 

Qubex Protocol is a `Blockchain-on-Blockchain` L2 built on the Internet Computer with a microservices architecture (canisters) that clearly separates cryptography, authentication, sequencing, and orchestration.

The protocol integrates post-quantum signatures (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) with optimized compression, a protected sequencer (VRF, commit-reveal), and native multi-chain vaults for Bitcoin and ICP, without fragile bridges.

Designed for enterprise use, Qubex Protocol provides consistent APIs, real-time monitoring, rate limiting, and comprehensive integration testing for secure and auditable deployments. The result: applications that are faster to deliver, more secure by design, and truly composable at scale.
